# Introduction

In this file, the guidelines to be followed to contribute to the project are written, covering topics such as commits, pull requests, issues, establishing a format for them and an orderly system for easy reading by other contributors.

Starting by stopping using Spanish for commits, I used Spanish because it was a small project, but surprisingly I scale very fast and looking to the future ... it is not scalable, although Spanish is not prohibited for pull requests or issues, it is recommended use English first of all, but if you need to explain the situation more and you cannot express yourself very well with English, you are welcome to use Spanish, don't worry, I'm Latin too ðŸŒ® :)
